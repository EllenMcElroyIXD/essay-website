    <h1> How has Sir Tim Burners Lee changed how we communicate today? </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> The World Wide Web (WWW) is a global networked environment of interconnected documents and data accessible through the internet. (McPherson, 2010). In this essay I will discuss one of the most innovative inventors in history – Sir Tim Burners Lee. Who is he? How did we communicate before the World Wide Web? Did Tim Burners Lee change how we communicate today? Sir Tim Burners Lee had a goal, his goal was to allow people to communicate freely with each other using computers. He wanted this to be easier to do rather than going up to somebody and asking them to go for coffee. </p>

    Sir Tim Burners Lee was born on June 8, 1955 and grew up in London. He went to Oxford University and obtained a first-class degree in Physics before beginning work at CERN, one of the worlds largest scientific research centres (McPherson, 2010). Tim was always fascinated by computers; at a young age he loved playing with toy trains. Tim Recalls: “I made some electronic gadgets to control the trains. Then I ended up getting more interested in electronics than trains. Later on, when I was in college, I made a computer out of an old television set.” <i>(World Wide Web Foundation, 2009)</i>.

  <h3 id="the-beginning"> The Beginning </h3>
    <p>
      In 1945, Dr Vennaver Bush said “Consider a future device …  in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” (Bush, 1945). This is the first record of anybody having an idea of the internet. Douglas Engelbert read the above quote and had a vision to use computing more effectively, he realised you could use computers not just for schools and business but also for personal use. With this idea he designed the first GUI and the first mouse.

  <h3 id="ARPANET"> ARPANET </h3>
    <p>
      DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) came up with a plan to connect computers together for use in the US military. They originally did this through telephone lines and realised that it wasn’t necessary to use three teletype machines to communicate with three incompatible computer systems. Robert Taylor came up with a more efficient and effective idea to communicate by using a single protocol that could merge these three terminals into one. This project was called ARPANET (The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) although for this to work, Paul Baran came up with the idea of ‘hot-potato routing’ which later became known as packet switching. This allowed larger files to be shared wirelessly between different computers by breaking them down into ‘packets’ which are clusters of information that are reduced in size and meet together at the destination computer fully merged again.

  <h3 id="the-history"> The History </h3>
    <p>
      Before the internet, computers were connected using dedicated cables from one computer to the other- a software program on one could communicate with a software program on the other by sending files or programs. One computer could not communicate with many other computers as this would require too many wires. The internet was up and running by the 1970’s, but transferring information was too complicated for a non-computer expert. (Burners-Lee, 1999). Then electronic mail (e-mail) was invented by Ray Tomlinson. E-mail allowed messages to be sent from one person to the other, universities in different countries started connecting together using email which was the beginning of the internet.
      Hypertext was invented in 1965 by Theodore Nelson. Hypertext is text that links to other information. By clicking on a link in a hypertext document, a user can quickly jump to different content. (Christensson, 2006). The first ISP was invented in 1974 when people wanted their home computers to connect to the internet, this required a protocol which was when TCP/IP was created. Every device that wanted to connect to the internet required a unique IP address. In 1983 a domain naming system was put in place which assigned domain names to IP addresses to make them easier to read for the non-computer expert. IP addresses went from looking like this ‘50.63.201.97’ to looking like this ‘www.domain.com’ which is much more readable to the human eye.

      Tim Burners-Lee soon realised you could share information using Nelson’s hypertext so in March 1989, he came up with a proposal for CERN called ‘Information Management: A Proposal’ writing on it ‘vague but exciting…’. (World Wide Web Foundation, 2009). He continued to work on this project for years and continued to face challenges along the way, but he was determined that he was on the right track as he continued to learn more about the internet and hypertext.

  <h3 id="the-web"> The Web </h3>
    <p>
      This wasn’t a simple project, there were many fundamental inventions needed before ‘the world wide web’ could officially be ‘the world wide web’. His first objective was to write a web client. Secondly, he had to figure out how to turn text into hypertext (HTTP), he wrote the code for the language computers would use to communicate over the web (HTML) and also invented URI’s. These remain the foundation of the web today. By the end of the 1990’s Tim had invented the first web page which is also still responsive today.
